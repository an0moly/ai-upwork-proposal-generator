{"prompt": "AI & Machine Learning\nData Science & Analytics\nHourly\n Please read our project description in detail before applying for this project.\n\nWe currently have a need for someone to help us use the ChatGPT API to develop medical content that is unique, accurate and follows our specific requirements.\n\nProject Scope: We are looking to develop detailed reports on 300 different diseases. Each report will be between 30,000 words and is broken down into 62 sections. These 62 sections will be the same across the 300 different diseases. For example, symptoms, treatment options, etc.\n\nHurdles we have encountered: So far when we used Chat GPT 4 manually, we ran accross a few issues. As part of your bid, please tell us if these issues can be resolved using the API or some other method you can intergrate in to the script you will develop for us:\n\n1) Our prompts are so detailed for each of the 62 sections that we often would hit the character limit on the web interface. Even when we told Chat GPT that we would submit our prompts as multiple submissions, it would start to ignore the multiple prompts and start providing the response prematurely.\n\n2) While we do have API access, we don't have access to the web browsing apps. However, for some sections we need Chat GPT to analyze web content, for example, Amazon product pages or Google Scholar results for medical research. Would there be a way for us to get Chat GPT to carry out real-time web browsing analysis?\n\n3) We have already done content on many diseases so in some ways, we have perfect examples of how we would like Chat GPT to deliver the content in each of the 62 sections for each disease. Is there a way for us to train the Chat GPT language model on our own data so that it knows how the content should flow, its tone, etc?\n\n4) A lot of sections are meant to be written based on the content developed for a previous section. In other words, for some sections, we want Chat GPT to take the content output of a previously generated section content and then do a new analysis/writeup based on specific requirements. Will the API allow us to use a piece of content we developed and give it to Chat GPT to use it as preliminary content to base a new writeup on?\n\nThe interface we want: Here is how we envision the interface you will be creating and the functionality that will go with it:\n\n1) There should be an Admin login where we can securely access the interface (we only plan on having 1 user)\n\n2) Once logged in, Admin should be able to create a new \"Project\" which is basically one of the 300 diseases. Admin should also be able to view other projects that have already been created.\n\n3) Once a project is created, Admin should be able to add sections that the content should have. \n\n- For each section, Admin should be able to provide detailed requirements on tone, length, any content points that must be included. \n\n- Admin should also be able to provide examples of that section done for other diseases so that Chat GPT knows exactly how the content should be written. \n\n- Admin should also be able tell Chat GPT to use the content generated for another previous section to do the writeup for the current section\n\n4) When Admin is done creating all sections and has provided detailed requirements for each section, there should be a \"Generate Content\" button that starts the content generation process. The content should be posted by each section.\n\n5) Admin should be able to then further improve the content for each section by providing feedback for that particular section and then have the option to either have the content for the section rewritten or the entire document rewritten with the new feedback in mind. \n\n-------\nSince this is going to be an ongoing, longterm project, please be detailed with your bid to let us know the following:\n\n- How long you anticipate the project to take to launch?\n\n- How do you anticipate addressing the 4 hurdles we encountered with the web version of Chat GPT?\n\n- Why you would be a good fit for this particular project?\n\nThank you in advance for taking your time to consider this job.\nUnited States\n50.0-120.0\n3 to 6 months\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hello Daniel, this project is a perfect fit!\n\nI\u2019m a veteran software engineer of over 16 years with extensive experience building fully scalable and custom web and mobile apps, including AI-integrated software development solutions.
