{"prompt": "Job Category Level One: AI & Machine Learning\nJob Category Level Two: Data Science & Analytics\nDescription:  Please read our project description in detail before applying for this project.\n\nWe currently have a need for someone to help us use the ChatGPT API to develop medical content that is unique, accurate and follows our specific requirements.\n\nProject Scope: We are looking to develop detailed reports on 300 different diseases. Each report will be between 30,000 words and is broken down into 62 sections. These 62 sections will be the same across the 300 different diseases. For example, symptoms, treatment options, etc.\n\nHurdles we have encountered: So far when we used Chat GPT 4 manually, we ran accross a few issues. As part of your bid, please tell us if these issues can be resolved using the API or some other method you can intergrate in to the script you will develop for us:\n\n1) Our prompts are so detailed for each of the 62 sections that we often would hit the character limit on the web interface. Even when we told Chat GPT that we would submit our prompts as multiple submissions, it would start to ignore the multiple prompts and start providing the response prematurely.\n\n2) While we do have API access, we don't have access to the web browsing apps. However, for some sections we need Chat GPT to analyze web content, for example, Amazon product pages or Google Scholar results for medical research. Would there be a way for us to get Chat GPT to carry out real-time web browsing analysis?\n\n3) We have already done content on many diseases so in some ways, we have perfect examples of how we would like Chat GPT to deliver the content in each of the 62 sections for each disease. Is there a way for us to train the Chat GPT language model on our own data so that it knows how the content should flow, its tone, etc?\n\n4) A lot of sections are meant to be written based on the content developed for a previous section. In other words, for some sections, we want Chat GPT to take the content output of a previously generated section content and then do a new analysis/writeup based on specific requirements. Will the API allow us to use a piece of content we developed and give it to Chat GPT to use it as preliminary content to base a new writeup on?\n\nThe interface we want: Here is how we envision the interface you will be creating and the functionality that will go with it:\n\n1) There should be an Admin login where we can securely access the interface (we only plan on having 1 user)\n\n2) Once logged in, Admin should be able to create a new \"Project\" which is basically one of the 300 diseases. Admin should also be able to view other projects that have already been created.\n\n3) Once a project is created, Admin should be able to add sections that the content should have. \n\n- For each section, Admin should be able to provide detailed requirements on tone, length, any content points that must be included. \n\n- Admin should also be able to provide examples of that section done for other diseases so that Chat GPT knows exactly how the content should be written. \n\n- Admin should also be able tell Chat GPT to use the content generated for another previous section to do the writeup for the current section\n\n4) When Admin is done creating all sections and has provided detailed requirements for each section, there should be a \"Generate Content\" button that starts the content generation process. The content should be posted by each section.\n\n5) Admin should be able to then further improve the content for each section by providing feedback for that particular section and then have the option to either have the content for the section rewritten or the entire document rewritten with the new feedback in mind. \n\n-------\nSince this is going to be an ongoing, longterm project, please be detailed with your bid to let us know the following:\n\n- How long you anticipate the project to take to launch?\n\n- How do you anticipate addressing the 4 hurdles we encountered with the web version of Chat GPT?\n\n- Why you would be a good fit for this particular project?\n\nThank you in advance for taking your time to consider this job.\nEngagement: 3 to 6 months\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hello Daniel, this project is a perfect fit!\n\nI\u2019m a veteran software engineer of over 16 years with extensive experience building fully scalable and custom web and mobile apps, including AI-integrated software development solutions.

For this is ok to rely on point-and-click  services\n*I would like to preserve the history of the changes. for example: a customer_id changes his name from \"Moises\" to \"Pedro\", I would like to have a table that only shows the latest one, \"Pedro\" but I would like to have another table where I can see both (or at least the previous one, \"Moises\").\n\nI'm a full-stack developer, tilting towards backend in python, so hopefully that expedite the solution. \n\nEngagement: 1 to 3 months\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hello from your neighbor in LA :)\n\nI believe we can work together on your database dev project - I am a  veteran software engineer with 16+ years of experience specializing in data architecture, database management, and data warehousing.

{"prompt": "Job Category Level One: Web Development\nJob Category Level Two: Web, Mobile & Software Dev\nDescription: I'm looking for a developer to take on a unique new job!  It's a website that solves a problem that I deal with frequently at work: determining if a given company is publicly traded or not.  It's surprisingly a pain to determine.  You have to go to Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or ultimately, to the SEC's Edgar tool and look up the company and see if there is a record.  I bought the domain, www.isupublic.com and thought maybe a tool where you drop in the name of a company, and maybe we scrape those sites above or take some other action to determine if the company is public.  If so, it displays the ticker symbol and the exchange it trades on. Love to get your thoughts on it:-) I would use this at work!\n\nOne can go to Yahoo Finance or or something but typically you can go to here: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html, at least for US-listed companies, and search for the definitive word.  If you get a returned result, the company has had a public filing.  I'm not sure what happens if a company used to be public but was taken private since and is now private (i.e. there could be old filings that show up) or if the company is public but is in the \"pink sheets\"; or traded in the over the counter market (OTC) where the company may not meet the bar for the NYSE or NASDAQ, etc.  We may need to consider these edge cases.  \n\nAfter the user types in the company name, maybe the tool returns a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\", the ticker symbol, and what exchange it's on ( NASDAQ or NYSE, etc.). I'm in visioning a simple UX, no clutter. Maybe a nice design for \"Is U Public\". A box to enter the company name, a button to execute the search and that's it. \n\nI'm open to suggestions from a design perspective. For example would you recommend scraping the financial sites live in a headless browser or something, or gathering up everything into a database and updating it periodically? Or maybe there are APIs to explore? Maybe not initially, but eventually we can store all of those returned searches in a Big Query DB.\n\nOR, do we do a one time download of all public companies could be one approach. There aren't a zillion public companies. There are only about 5000 public companies in the US between the NASDAQ and NYSE. Would it be cool to build a database once and then update it each month or so? Each week to catch IPOs and delistings?\n\nMaybe for Phase 1 it's a live scape once the user enters a company name.  Phase 2 might be storing that information in a DB, or adopting the download all companies into a DB approach.\n\nMaybe we skip the pink sheet companies for this version. But, at the end of the day, I'm open to your suggestions!\n\nDeliverables\n1 - scope estimate after discovery\n2 - detailed description of functionality, API, data pipelines, etc\n3 - functioning website \n4 - recommendations for future upgrades \n\nCommunications Approach \n- Upwork notes\n- Zoom or Meet call if needed/useful\nEngagement: 1 to 3 months\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hello Larry,\n\nI see you need a web-based app to determine whether a company is public.

Their listings will be blank items, and need artwork from Merchants in order to fullfill.\n\nMerchant (this would be a Customer) - they have an ecommerce store, Etsy, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc... and they need to connect with a \nProvider for drop ship fulfillment of their designed, print on demand products.\n\nThe key thing to note is that a Provider would have their products only available to the Merchants that they give access to their storefront.

{"prompt": "Job Category Level One: Web & Mobile Design\nJob Category Level Two: Web, Mobile & Software Dev\nDescription: Hey all potential candidates,\n\nMy name is Nick and I run a sports media company called BDGE, which has a very specific focus on fantasy football (NFL American Football). We're largely present on social media platforms (YouTube, TikTok) - easily findable if you search BDGE on them!\n\nWe currently have a website (www.bdge.co) that basically serves as our e-commerce store. I currently work with a contracted engineer who built the website over the last year or so, pretty much on a full-time basis. I don't know the framework which he used to build out the website (I can find out) but I'm pretty sure it's not common among developers. He was a bit underskilled in the area (contextual to what exactly I needed built) and I think he chose the one with the lowest learning curve/built through creative/non-conventional avenues. He was building on Heroku with DJango I believe if that helps at all? (I'm not knowledgeable in engineering so I apologize if I sound ignorant here) I'm only telling you this because he built out a lot of stuff for us and has a ton of API integrations already set up on there so if you're familiar with whichever way he was building it could save a lot of time rebuilding it.\n\nAnyway, I basically need someone to rebuild this website in a somewhat new way, but with a much heavier emphasis on front-end and design.\n\nA summary of the website currently:\n- We sell 3 separate products on the website. Two (2) info products (which are one-time purchases) and a membership pass (which is paid monthly by the user).\n- The info products simply unlock different parts of the website that are private beforehand.\n- The monthly membership gets people to access to a private channel in our Discord Server (so there needs to be a link between their account on our website and Discord)\n\nThe plan for the website redesign is to combine all three of these offerings into one single monthly membership product, with the ability to upsell in the future.\n\nThe website requires a heavy amount of API Integration (from partner companies, from websites that we pull football data and statistics from, etc) so knowledge in this is an absolute must.\n\nThere are also sections of the website that are mainly blog-focused with video integration that will need to have the ability for myself to edit yearly. New players enter the NFL and we'll need new profiles on the players that enter, so new API integration will be necessary.\n\nFuture plans for the website after the foundation is built out:\n1. As the owner, I need the ability to understand the interface/dashboard of our product so that he can go in and easily: Create promo codes of any level (% or fixed) at any time, Have the ability to check current customers: name, email, how long they\u2019ve been a member for, etc. Create free memberships to give away (maybe for friends/family, maybe doing lifetime giveaways), The totality of our customer base at any given moment: how many subscribers we currently have, how many we had last month, turnover, how much revenue we made during custom time-frames (MTD, last month, last year, YTD, etc).\n\n2. Allow our audience to play trivia games (https://bit.ly/43eND86) that we play on our TikTok, with the ability to create an account via collecting their email and play the game.\n\n3. Integrate our merch store (Printful+Shopify) that's currently on a different URL (www.bdge.shop).\n\n4. Link our site with ConvertKit so members are automatically uploaded to our email list\n\n5.
